	C# (pronounced see sharp, like the musical note Câ™¯, but written with the number sign) is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming 
	language encompassing static typing, strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, 
	object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines.

	ava is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. 
	It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled 
	Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java applications are typically compiled to 
	bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar 
	to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic 
	capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages. 
	As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub, particularly for client-server web 
	applications, with a reported 9 million developers.

	Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its 
	notable use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write 
	clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.
